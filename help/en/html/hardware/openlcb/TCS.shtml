      <h1>Hardware Support: OpenLCB on TCS hardware</h1>
      <em>JMRI support for OpenLCB is rapidly evolving; the actual code might be ahead or behind
      the documentation on any given day.</em>
      <p>This page describes JMRI's support for TCS hardware via OpenLCB. It's part of JMRI's
      <a href="index.shtml">documentation of its OpenLCB support</a>.</p>

      <h2>The TCS CS-105 Command Station</h2>

        <h3>Connections</h3>

        JMRI can connect to a TCS CS-105 command station using OpenLCB/LCC two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Via the CAN bus and a USB-CAN adapter.
            <li>Via a direct network connection.
        </ul>

        <h3>Roster Support</h3>
            <span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.4.shtml">JMRI 5.3.4</a></span>

            To copy the function labels from a DecoderPro
            roster entry to the corresponding locomotive entry in the CS-105 command station
            for use with UWT-100 throttles:
            <ul>
                <li>Open the DecoderPro roster entry from which you want to transfer
                    the function labels.  This must have the same DCC address as the
                    entry in the CS-105. If you don't yet have a roster entry for the locomotive,
                    you should create one and fill out its function labels and DCC address.
                <li>In the File -> Export... menu on the roster entry, select "Roster Entry to TCS CS-105"
                <li>Wait for the completion dialog.
            </ul>

            To copy the function labels from locomotive entry in a CS-105 command
            station to the corresponding DecoderPro roster entry:
            <ul>
                <li>Open the corresponding DecoderPro roster entry.
                    This must have the same DCC address as the
                    entry in the CS-105. If you don't yet have a roster entry for the locomotive,
                    you should create one and fill out its DCC address.
                <li>In the File -> Import... menu on the roster entry, select "TCS CS-105 Roster Entry"
                <li>Wait for the completion dialog.
                <li>Save your DecoderPro roster entry.
            </ul>

            With the File -> Export -> "TCS backup file..." menu item, you can also
            create formatted backup files suitable for
            restoring to a TCS train node using the "Restore..."
            button on the Configure Nodes screen.
            <p>
            With the File -> Import -> "TCS backup file..." menu item, you can read
            a file created by the "Backup..." button on the Configure Nodes
            screen into your roster entry.
            <p>
            When transferring from the DecoderPro roster to the CS-105,
            DecoderPro will use the contents of the consisting control
            bits on the Consist pane to set the consisting control in
            the CS-105 and vice versa.  Please note that, depending
            on the decoder type, there might not be consist bits defined
            for all functions. Many decoders only define F1 through F12,
            for example. In those cases, the undefined consisting
            bits will have their consist controls in the CS-105 left unchanged.
