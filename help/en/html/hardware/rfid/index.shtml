            <h1>Hardware Support: RFID Readers</h1>
            <p>JMRI supports RFID readers in several different ways:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Attached via USB or network protocols using Preferences "RFID Connection"</li>
               <li>Not directly attached to JMRI but sending <a href="../mqtt/index.shtml">MQTT messages</a></li>
               <li>Using scripting to update <a href="../../tools/IdTags.shtml"><i>IdTags</i></a> and <a href="../../tools/Reporters.shtml"><i>Reporter Tables</i></a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a general introduction on how to get started with RFID in JMRI, see <a href="GettingStartedWithRFID.shtml">
               Getting Started with RFID</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 id="hardware">Direct Connected Supported Hardware</h2>
            <p>RFID hardware can be connected using <a href="../../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml"><strong>Preferences Connections</strong></a> and selecting "RFID" as the "System Manufacturer".</p>

            <h3>Protocols</h3>
            JMRI supports several different RFID Reader Protocols:
            <ul>
               <li>CORE-ID / ID-Innovations - since version 2.11.4. These are supported in stand-alone
                  mode via the 'Generic Stand-alone' protocol and as an up-to 8-way Concentrator using <a href=
                     "http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a> hardware via the 'MERG Concentrator' protocol.
               </li>
               <li>Olimex MOD-RFID125 - since v 3.9.2</li>
               <li>Olimex MOD-RFID1356MIFARE - since v 4.7.5</li>
               <li>Parallax - since v 3.9.2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choose the appropriate Protocol when setting the Preferences.</p>
            <p>JMRI also supports up to 8 individual readers connected via a Concentrator. Right now, the
               only supported Concentrator is that from <a href="../merg/Details.shtml#c7">MERG</a>, and
               then only for readers using the CORE-ID protocol. [Note: <a href="../arduinos/index.shtml">arduinos</a>
               can also be programmed to emulate the MERG concentrator.]
               <br>
               Select "MERG Concentrator" for the "Adapter" on the Connections tab in the JMRI
               Preferences. Note: The <a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a> starter kit as supplied should be
               configured using the 'Generic Stand-alone' protocol - only when extending the kit with the
               additional concentrator components should the 'MERG Concentrator' protocol be used.
            </p>
            </p>
 
            <h3 id="connecting">Connecting</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Direct serial connections have been supported since JMRI 2.11.4</li>
               <li>Network connections are targeted for the JMRI 4.1.2 release series.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preferences Settings</h3>
            <a href="images/RFID_Preferences.png"><img src="images/RFID_Preferences.png" class=
               "floatRight" height="220" width="430" alt="JMRI RFID Preferences"></a>
            <p>You configure JMRI's connection to your RFID hardware in JMRI's Preferences.<br>
               It appears as "RFID" in the System Manufacturer drop-down list.
            </p>
            <p>The "Baud rate" advanced connection setting is typically not critical for USB-connected
               RFID connections so it may be "greyed out" to indicate that it is not selectable.
            </p>

            <h3>Reader Configuration</h3>

            <h4>Olimex readers</h4>
            <p>Olimex MOD-RFID125 and MOD-RFID1356MIFARE readers must be operating in "CDC" mode. This
               mode is typically configured using a pushbutton on the reader.
            </p>

            <h3>Monitoring</h3>
            <p>
               Open an RFID Command Monitor window to see the RFID tags as they are received.
            </p>
            <p>
               Open a window to see the tags and the Road name Car number (if the tag is associated to a Car in
               OperationsPro. see <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rfid/swing/tagcarwin/TagMonitorPane.shtml">Monitor
               RFID Tags by Car</a> for
               details.
            </p>

            <h2>Object Naming</h2>
            <p>
               The <a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">system letter</a> for RFID connections 
               defined on JMRI Preferences is "F". Details of RFID event and object names are described below. 
               <!-- , with technical details on a <a href="Names.shtml">separate page</a> -->
            </p>
            <p>JMRI associates RFID events with individual JMRI objects (Sensors, Reporters, etc.) via
               System Names. A System Name like "<code>FSA</code>" defines a Sensor that follows the "A"
               reader, whereas a System Name like "<code>FRB</code>" defines a Reporter that follows the "B"
               reader. [Note that readers using MQTT will begin with "M" and readers controlled by scripts will
               typically begin with "I" (for internal).
            </p>

            <h3>Sensors</h3>
            <p>
               RFID readings coming from defined RFID connections can be accessed via JMRI Sensor objects. The
               Sensor's <!-- <a href="Names.shtml">system name</a> -->System Name determines which RFID
               Reader it corresponds to.
            </p>
            <p>A Sensor is defined by two events: The one that sets it ACTIVE, and the one that sets it
               INACTIVE. When an RFID Tag is within the proximity of an RFID Reader, the associated sensor
               is ACTIVE; outside of these times it is INACTIVE. You create Sensors using the <a href=
                  "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button on the <a href=
                  "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor Table</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Reporters</h3>
            <p>
               RFID readings coming into JMRI applications can also be accessed via JMRI Reporter
               objects. The Reporter's <!-- <a href="Names.shtml">system name</a> -->system name determines
               which RFID Reader it corresponds to.
            </p>
            <p>A Reporter can contain arbitrary information, unlike a Sensor which is only ACTIVE or
               INACTIVE. Each Reporter is associated with some specific source of information on the layout,
               and makes that devices information available to the rest of JMRI.
            </p>
            <p>When an RFID Reader reports that a specific tag has been seen, the corresponding Reporter
               will contain details of the specific <a href="../../tools/IdTags.shtml">IdTag</a> seen. This
               then enables other JMRI tools to react to this information.
            </p>

            <h4>Reporter Table</h4>
            <p>The <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterTable.shtml">Reporter Table</a>
               provides easy access to the contents of all Reporters that JMRI knows about. JMRI
               automatically creates Reporter objects for devices discovered on the layout.<br>
               There's also an <a href=
                  "../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/ReporterAddEdit.shtml">"Add..." button</a> for
               manually creating your own internal Reporters.
            </p>

            <h2>Displaying Reporter Values on Panels</h2>
            <p>
               A Reporter's value can be displayed on panels in various ways.   See <a href="GettingStartedWithRFID.shtml#_Toc143">
               Linking PanelPro tables to display RFID Tag names on panels</a> for instructions.
