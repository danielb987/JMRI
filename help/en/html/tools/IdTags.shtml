      <h1>JMRI: ID Tags Documentation</h1>

      <h2>What are ID Tags?</h2>

      <p>An ID Tag is JMRI's way of representing information about ID Tags that can be attached to,
      for example, various items of rolling stock.</p>
 
      <p>When an ID Tag is read by a suitable reader (such as a transponder or a connected 
      <a href="../hardware/rfid/index.shtml">RFID reader</a>): </p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>If the ID Tag is detected for the first time, details of this tag will be automatically
      entered into the <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag
      Table</a>.</li>
      <li>JMRI will also put the value read into a <a href="Reporters.shtml">Reporter</a> and
      set a <a href="Sensors.shtml">Sensor</a> to ACTIVE.</li>
      <li>The ID Tag Table entry will also record which Reporter it was last seen by as well as
      the time it was last seen.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are other ways of getting information into the JMRI ID Tag Table, including 
      manually (see below) and via <a href="../hardware/mqtt/index.shtml">MQTT</a>
      messages and <a href="scripting/index.shtml">scripts.</a>]
      </p>

      
      <p>For general information on using ID Tags with RFID Readers, see <a href="../hardware/rfid/GettingStartedWithRFID.shtml">
      Getting Started With RFID</a>.</p>

      <h2>How to setup ID Tags</h2>

      <h3>ID Tag Table</h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagTable.shtml">ID Tag Table</a>
      provides easy access to the contents of all ID Tags that JMRI knows about.</p>

      <h3>ID Tag Table Controls</h3>

      <p>Id Tags may be entered manually as well as automatically as noted above.</p>  
      
      <p>At the bottom of 
      the table window there is an <a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/IdTagAddEdit.shtml">
      <strong>"Add..."</strong> button</a> for creating your own ID Tags. Next to this button, two
      check boxes let you activate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Save when and where last seen</li>
        <li>Use Fast Clock Time</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Displaying ID Tags on Panels</h3>

      <p>
      There are several ways to display the contents of ID Tags on Layout Editor and Panel Editor Panels.
      See the references for these editors for details, and <a href="GettingStartedWithRFID.shtml#_Toc135">
      Getting Started with RFID</a> for an introduction to this topic (also applicable to other types of 
      ID Tags).
      </p>
      
      <p>An ID Tag can be displayed on a Panel Editor Panel via the use of the Reporter Icon associated
      with a given reader. To do this:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>On the Panel Editor window for your Panel, find the "Add Reporter" button.</li>

        <li>In the text box next to that button, type the User Name or System Name of the desired
        Reporter.</li>

        <li>Click the button. The Reporter icon will be placed on the Panel. If it's not visible,
        that might be because the value is currently blank; use the Reporter Table to change the
        value to something that will be visible.</li>

        <li>You can drag the icon to where you want it in the usual way.</li>

        <li>The pop-up menu on the Reporter Icon will let you change the formatting.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More information about Reporters can be found in the <a href="Reporters.shtml">Reporters
      help page</a>.</p>

      <h3>Saving ID Tags to disk</h3>

      <p>ID Tags are not stored with the other tables. Whenever an ID Tag is changed, the details of
      all ID Tags known to the system are automatically written to a file stored in the <em>idtags</em>
      sub-directory of the <em>user files location</em>. The storage of when and where a given ID Tag
      was last seen is configurable by checking the box at the bottom of the ID Tag Table window.
