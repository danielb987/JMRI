      <h2>The clipboard</h2>

      <h3>Cut/Copy/Paste/Paste copy</h3>

      <p>While editing a ConditionalNG, it can be useful to <strong>cut</strong> out something,
      edit something else, and then <strong>paste</strong> it back. Chapter 1 has a good example.
      For this purpose, LogixNG has a clipboard. Each time you cut an action or expression, it is
      moved to the clipboard.</p>

      <p>It also possible to <strong>copy</strong> all or part of a ConditionalNG. This can then be
      pasted into the same ConditionalNG, another ConditionalNG or even a different LogixNG.</p>

      <p>The LogixNG context menu contains four items for working with the clipboard.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/chapter2/clipboard_actions.png"><img class="image-border" src=
        "images/chapter2/clipboard_actions.png" alt="Chapter 2 clipboard actions"></a>
      </div>

      <dl>
        <dt>Cut</dt>
        <dd>The row and its children are removed from the ConditionalNG and added the clipboard.</dd>

        <dt>Copy</dt>
        <dd>The row and its children are copied from the ConditionalNG and added the clipboard.</dd>

        <dt>Paste</dt>
        <dd>The first row in the clipboard is pasted to the empty row and removed from the clipboard.</dd>

        <dt>Paste copy</dt>
        <dd>The first row in the clipboard is copied and then pasted to the empty row.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Working with the clipboard</h3>

      <p>The clipboard editor works the same way as the ConditionalNG editor, with the exception
      that actions and expressions are never active while on the clipboard.</p>

      <p>The clipboard contents are visible by selecting <strong>Tools &rArr; Open clipboard</strong>.
      The clipboard can also be opened from the main menu of the three LogixNG tables.</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        <a href="images/chapter2/chapter2_clipboard.png"><img src=
        "images/chapter2/chapter2_clipboard.png" alt="Chapter 2 clipboard"></a>
      </div>

      <p>In the ConditionalNG editor window, copy and cut add to the beginning of the clipboard
      list. Paste uses the <strong><em>first</em></strong> item in the clipboard list and it will
      be <strong>deleted</strong> from clipboard list.  <strong>Paste copy</strong> does not remove
      the item.</p>

      <p>In the clipboard window, copy creates a <strong>duplicate</strong> item and adds it to the
      beginning of the list. Cut <strong>moves</strong> the item to the beginning of the list.
      <strong>Remove</strong> will <strong>delete</strong> the item from the clipboard list.</p>

      <p>Note that you can cut an item on any level in the clipboard tree. While editing a
      ConditionalNG, you may cut a big tree from the ConditionalNG and you then take only a small
      sub tree and paste back to the ConditionalNG.</p>

      <pre>
Example:
* Many
  * IfThenElse
    * If sensor
    * Then Throw turnout
</pre>
      <p>You can cut the Many action from the ConditionalNG, then go to the clipboard and expand
      the Many action and then cut the IfThenElse action. The IfThenElse action will then be moved
      to the first row on the clipboard. Now you can go back to the ConditionalNG and paste the
      IfThenElse action to the ConditionalNG.</p>

      <p>If the popup menu is opened on an item that can be copied, the menu item Copy is enabled.
      If "Copy" is selected, the item and its sub tree are copied to the clipboard. Each item gets
      an auto system name and no user name.</p>
