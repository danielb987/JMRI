      <hr>

      <p>This window is opened from the main PanelPro/DecoderPro&reg; <strong>Tools</strong> menu, or
      from its Operations menu; and alternatively from <strong>Location</strong> pane
      <strong>Tools</strong> menu, <strong>Show Cars</strong> and various windows'
      <strong>Operations</strong> menus.</p>

      <p>The Cars window allows you to view and edit your Car Roster or add a Car by entering a
      Car's Number, Road, Type and Length. The program will automatically calculate the Car's
      weight based on length and the scale you are modeling. Optionally the Car's Color, Build
      date, Load and Owner can be added. You may want to switch a group of Cars as a unit, then you
      may create a "Kernel". You can assign any number of Cars to a Kernel but the type of the
      first Car assigned will be used by the program to determine if the Kernel is allowed at a
      Location. The entire length of the Kernel is used to determine if the Cars in the Kernel will
      fit at a Location.<br>
      Note that the program also includes space for each Car's couplers when calculating the length
      of a Kernel.</p>

      <p>The complete Cars Roster is displayed:</p>

      </p>

      <h4>To the right of each Car entry</h4>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Set</span> button opens the <strong><a href=
      "Ops_Locations_setCars.shtml">Set Car Location</a></strong> window.</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Edit</span> button opens the <a href=
      "Ops_AddCars.shtml"><strong>Edit Car</strong></a> window, similar to the <strong>Add
      Car</strong> window.</p>

      <h4>Bottom of the panel</h4>

      <p>A series of radio buttons that allow you to select the sort order. Also the total number
      of Cars is displayed.</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Add</span> button opens the <strong><a href=
      "Ops_AddCars.shtml">Add Car</a></strong> window and allows you to add a new Car to your
      Roster.</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Save</span> button saves the Car Roster to disk.</p>

      <p><span class="textbutton">Find</span> <input name="textfield" id=
      "textfield" size="10" type="text"> Used to find a Car by its Road Number. The wild card "*"
      (without quotes) may be used when entering a car number.</p>

      <p>For example, if you want to find all the Cars with a Number ending in ...345 , enter *345
      and each time you press on <span class="textbutton">Find</span> , the
      next Car with the ...345 ending will be displayed.</p>
      <!-- New in version 3.10 -->

      <div style="margin:40px; padding:10px; background-color:#eee;">New in v3.6: More compact
      Roster sorting
      <p>Instead of 14 identical Radio buttons, a more compact grouping of sort buttons fills the
      bottom of the pane. Clicking one of the buttons inside a grey rectangle hides the other items
      in the group and sorts the Roster. Selecting "Color" would hide the "Load" column and vice
      versa.</p>
