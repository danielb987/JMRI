      <p>The <strong>Add Route</strong> window opens to add a Route to your OperationsPro
      database.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute.png" alt="add route" height="239" width="900">
      </p>
      Type the Route <strong>Name</strong> <input name="textfield" id="textfield" size="30" type=
      "text"> Each route must have a unique Name.
      <p>Then press <span class="textbutton">Add</span> located at the bottom of the pane.
      The <strong>Add Route</strong> window now activates the attributes required to enter the Route.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute01.png" alt="add route" height="239" width="900">
      </p>

      <p>Select the Location from which the Train will depart by selecting the Location
      <select name="select" id="select">
        <option>
          North Yard
        </option>
      </select> located at the left bottom side of the window.</p>

      <p>Select <input name="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked="checked" type="radio"> Add
      location to start <input name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2" type="radio"> Add location
      at end</p>

      <p>Press <span class="textbutton">Add Location</span> An updated
      <strong>Add Route</strong> window will be displayed with all the attributes required active.
      Repeat until all stops are entered for the Route.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute02.png" alt="add route" height="239" width="900">
      </p>

      <p>We will now add all the Locations to the Route. Each time you add a Location to the Route,
      the table shows the order in which the Train will visit them. Make sure that <input name=
      "radio3" id="radio3" value="radio3" checked="checked" type="radio"> <strong>Add location at
      end</strong> is selected to add after the first location.</p>

      <p>Build your Route by selecting the next Location the Train will visit; select all Locations
      that the Train will pass through even if the Train will not work the Location. This way your
      train's engineer will know when reading his Manifest the towns he will be traveling
      through.</p>

      <p>Make sure you press <span class="textbutton">Save Route</span>
      when you are done entering the Locations.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute03.png" alt="route" height="350" width="900">
      </p>

      <p>Each <strong>Location</strong> has the Train's departure direction (<strong>Train
      Direction</strong>), number of desired car <strong>Moves</strong> and whether Car
      <strong>Pickups?</strong> and/or car <strong>Drops?</strong> are allowed at that
      Location.</p>

      <p>You can also adjust the maximum Train length (<strong>Max Length</strong>) that can depart
      that Location.</p>

      <p>A Car <strong>Move</strong> can be a car Pickup or car Drop at that Location. For example,
      5 Moves can be 5 Pickups or 5 Drops or any combination of 5 Pickups and Drops.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Grade</strong> is used to determine how many Engines the Train will require
      for that segment. The <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> are the coordinates on your
      dispatcher's Panel for the optional Train Icon. You can set the coordinates here, or use the
      "SetX&amp;Y" Train Icon popup menu to teach the program where you want the Train Icon placed
      when the Train is at the specified location in OperationsPro. Leave the X and Y coordinates
      at zero if you want to manually move the icon or you're not using the icon feature. After
      setting the number of moves, maximum length, or coordinates, click on the table to make sure
      it is recognized and stored by the program.</p>

      <p>You may move the selected Location <span class="textbutton">Up</span> or 
      <span class="textbutton">Down</span> to change its position in the list.</p>

      <p>You may add a comment for each location. In the Comment column press <span class="textbutton">Add</span> .<br>
      <img src="images/Ops_AddRoute_comments.png" alt="comments" height="128" width="268"><br></p>

      <p>Press <span class="textbutton">Save Route</span> to save your
      route. The program will create a file (OperationsRouteRoster.xml) in your JMRI directory in a
      folder called "operations". A backup file with the last settings for all of your routes is
      also created each time <span class="textbutton">Save Route</span> is pressed.</p>

      <p>Now we have our first Route set up.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_AddRoute04.png" alt="route" height="365" width="900">
      </p>

      <p>You may start a new Route using the <strong>Add Route</strong> window and entering a new
      Route Name and repeat this process for each Route.</p>

      <p>Now back to the Route window, which will show us a list of all the Routes.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Ops_Routes01.png" alt="routes" height="310" width="730">
      </p>

      <p>Note that you may press <span class="textbutton">Edit</span> on
      any Route and the <strong><a href="Ops_EditRoutes.shtml">Edit Route</a></strong> window
      opens, similar to the <strong>Add Route</strong> window.</p>

      <p>You may now press <span class="textbutton">Add</span> to add another Route,
      repeating the process just completed, or close the <strong>Route</strong> pane.</p>
