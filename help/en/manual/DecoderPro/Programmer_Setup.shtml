      <hr>

      <p>Prior to using the programmer you need to have completed the previous section (<a href=
      "Start_DCC.shtml">Getting Started</a>), have your computer connected to your command
      station/booster with the required interface device for your DCC system, you are now ready to
      actually program a decoder that has been installed in your locomotive.</p>

      <p><br>
      On opening DecoderPro, the main page will be displayed: (After preferences are set)</p>

      <div class="dp-center"><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" width="496" height="282" alt=
      "splash">
      </div>

      <p>There are four buttons near the bottom, the first two of which are:</p>

      <p><strong><span class="textbutton"><a href="Programmer_ServiceMode.shtml">Service Mode 
      (Programming Track) Programmer</a></span> <a href="Programmer_ServiceMode.shtml">Service Mode</a></strong> -
      With this button you select a programmer to program the locomotive(decoder) on the dedicated
      programming track. (Probably because the Locomotive has to be taken to the servicing track to
      be programmed). Not all command stations support a dedicated programming track, and some
      brands will shut down the mainline power when in programming mode (not pleasant when you have
      an ops session in progress.</p>

      <p><strong><span class="textbutton"><a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml">Operations Mode 
      (Main Track ) Programmer</a></span> <a href="Programmer_OpsMode.shtml">Operations Mode</a></strong> - or
      <strong>[Programming on the main(POM)]</strong>. This lets you program a specific decoder on
      the layout, even while it is operating. However, because it addresses a specific decoder
      address, some decoders will not allow you to change the decoder's address using this method!
      Some command stations will only "broadcast" programming commands, which can mean every
      locomotive on the layout gets the same programming! The same is true if you try to program a
      loco with address zero (or forget to enter an address when you start). If in doubt, check
      your documentation.</p>

      <p><strong><span class="textbutton">Help</span></strong> - Accesses the help files<br></p>

      <p><strong><span class="textbutton">Quit</span></strong> - Exits the program.</p>

      <p>Any additional buttons are added in the <strong><a href=
      "Start_Preferences.shtml">preferences</a></strong>.</p>

      <h2>Additional programmers that are available.</h2>

      <p><a href="Programmer_SingleCV.shtml"><strong>Single CV Programmer</strong></a> Lets you
      program older decoders one CV at a time.</p>

      <p><a href="Programmer_Multi_Decoder.shtml"><strong>Multi-Programmer Control</strong></a>
      provides a convenient way to program CV's when you have more than one decoder installed in a
      locomotive. For example, if you have separate decoders to control the motor and provide
      sound, and they both use the same CV locations, programming one decoder would change the
      settings on the other, usually an undesired feature.</p>

      <p>Now that you have decided on which Programming Mode to use, you may continue</p>
